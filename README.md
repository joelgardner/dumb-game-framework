# dumb-game-framework
A small ECS "framework" created as a learning exercise.

# In this repo
This repo is divided into two directories: `framework` and `examples`. 

The files in `framework` are the components of the generic game framework, comprised of an ECS implementation, a game-loop (using `requestAnimationFrame`), and asset loading helpers.

The files in `examples` are game-specific logic meant to show how to create simple games with the framework. Currently, only a very simple Mario simulator example exists.
